### R code for simulation studies
The R code for simulation study is given by [here](/Exam1.md).


#### R code for pararellization computatioanl time TSJM package and its dynamic prediction. 
The R code for the simulation study using the TSJM package can be found [here](/Exam3.md).



### Computational time of TSJM
To evaluate the computational time of the TSJM package for Two-Stage Joint Modeling through parallelization, we generate a single sample, as presented [here](/Exam1.md), and assess its performance with repetition [here](/Exam2.md).
