### Computational time of TSJM
For checking computational time of TSJM package for Two-stage Joint Modeling via parallization we consider generation just one sample which is presented [here](/Exam1.md) and with repetation in [here](/Exam1.md).


To evaluate the computational time of the TSJM package for Two-Stage Joint Modeling through parallelization, we generate a single sample, as presented [here](/Exam1.md), and assess its performance with repetition [here](/Exam2.md).
